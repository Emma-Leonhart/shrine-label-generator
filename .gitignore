# This .gitignore is intentionally minimal.
# Flesh this out once the project language,
# tooling, and runtime environment are known.

# Claude:
# - Expand this file only after project scope is clear.
# - Avoid speculative or catch-all ignore rules.
# - Data files such as csv files might be essential files to be tracked in this repo

## PLACEHOLDER DESCRIPTION

This repository was created via a command-line bootstrap process and initialized as a Git repository immediately.
This section should be replaced with a concrete project description as soon as the purpose of the repository is known.

---

## Initial repository contents

This repository is intentionally initialized with a small number of files.
Each file has a specific purpose in the early-stage workflow:

- README.md
  Human-facing documentation. This file should be updated as soon as the project’s purpose and scope are known.

- CLAUDE.md
  Instructions and constraints for AI-assisted development, including workflow rules and commit expectations.

- .gitignore
  Intentionally minimal. Exists to reserve the decision space for ignore rules once tooling is known.

- runClaude.bat
  Convenience script to launch Claude from the repository root with the correct working directory.

- runCodex.bat
  Convenience script to launch Codex from the repository root with the correct working directory.

No assumptions are made yet about language, framework, runtime, or tooling.
All such decisions should be introduced explicitly and recorded in Git history.

---

## Intended workflow

This project is intended to be developed by launching an AI assistant via the provided batch scripts
and iteratively editing files and committing changes as decisions are made.

Planning-only modes should be avoided in favor of durable file edits and frequent commits.

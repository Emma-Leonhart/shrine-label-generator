IMPORTANT
Do not enter planning-only modes. All thinking must produce files and commits.
if the scope is not immediately clear make the directory /planning and create many .md files there explaining the planning process instead of using your own planning mode
please replace the PLACEHOLDER DESCRIPTION section of readme.md with a proper project summary as soon as the purpose of the repo is known. 
## Project Context
This is a new, empty repository created on -2026-02-10 - at 03:13 PM using the `new-repo.bat` bootstrapping tool.
The intent is to use Claude Code to build and populate this project from scratch.

## Workflow Guidelines
- **Commit early and often.** Every meaningful change should be committed with a clear, descriptive summary that explains *why* the change was made, not just what changed.
- **Keep this claude.md up to date.** As the project takes shape, update this file with architectural decisions, conventions, dependencies, and anything Claude needs to know to work effectively in this repo. It is not useful to keep the boostrapping project context info in claude.md once a project is up and running.
- **Do not enter planning mode, please clearly edit the repo with every single architectural decision and even just thoughts you have. Commit them frequently, because commits can be easily undone**
- **Please regularly update the human aimed readme.md to provide more context for a human user**

## Project Description

## old possibly implemented thing

okay so I'm explaining

OK so I am currently writing this on my phone with speech to text so it'll be a bit in precise but basically I am trying to explain what is going on with this repository I wanna watch it so what I wanted to change with this repository is basically well firstly there was a build failure and I'm not sure if the build is working now but the build failure is definitely an annoying thing that I should be dealing with as for as for the main stuff going on with this suppository though as for the main stuff going on with it basically there are some languages that I want to introduce that are not on the repository right now for example I want to introduce Hindi like ideal ideally I would wanna basically make this supply for like the top 10 most spoken languages or top 20 most spoken languages but the thing is I don't just want to do that you see what I also want to do is I want to I want to start proposing English/Indonesian labels for the shrine for about 10,000 or so to shrines that currently only have a Japanese label so this is this is this is currently a lot so the history of the Indonesian labels is that I mass created English French and Indonesian Indonesian labels from the from the existing articles on shrines search from the existing Japanese labels mini labels but the best majority of them the reason why I stopped trying to mass translate all English labels was that I the main reason why I decided to stop trying to mass translate all English labels was basically because I found shrines were being added too fast for me to add English labels so a lot of the a lot of these shrines that currently have English labels but do not have Indonesian or French labels are ones that are ones that were strange edge cases like parts of shrines or things like that 

Once we start doing this though I want the quick statements to be relatively segregated what I want to try to implement is something where the quick statements actually have comments explaining the Indian explaining what they were the source was basically for all of the existing quick statements except for in Chinese and except for in Chinese and Korean the labels are derived from the Indonesian label but I would like you to give the Indonesian label in the English label correctly there so that I can really just so that I can so that a user could see what the logic was for what became what and for a hand for Chinese the Chinese labels are basically all just identified versions of the Japanese congee the English and the French labels are just just have a simple logic of just just have a very simple logic of transformation of off of the Indonesian labels they just have the DE space or D's thing like the duh that is supposed to indicate that indicate the like I don't fucking know what it is it's not real I don't think it's really generative it's something else it might be a generative ablative I don't know whatever it is that's the thing for the French labels and the French that's a thing for the French labels and they are they are they're pretty regular transformations I am pretty sure that we have structured it specifically so that with a sparkle queries the sparkle queries specifically do not generate do not generate labels for things that already have labels 

So what I would want to do now is basically I want to have some logic in place to at least analyze the the existing analyze English Indonesian in French and kind of figure out what the gaps are so that we can try to fill them out and for the but I also want to try to have a a pipeline like a secondary pipeline that a secondary pipeline that actually creates the English and Indonesian proposed translations for the different shrine things from the congee or the or the continent names so that  


sorry the pipeline will attempt to regularize English French Indonesian because when there are gaps where something does not have a label in all of these language languages it usually indicates that there was some kind of a technical issue that I faced when I was adding the labels 

so there will be a section of proposed labels based on this

i want a pipeline that generates Indonesian proposed labels based on Kanji and kana for exclusively japanese labeled shrines

This pipeline will create a specific thing I think a CSV file that has the Indonesian proposed labels and they will all be regular 

All of the existing pipelines will use these Indonesian labels as a base to produce English and French labels and also labels in all of the other languages one's coming from this CSV because of the nature of it being based upon non-established shrines these ones are going to be more limited or these are going to be separate they will be at the bottom of the page of all of the quick statements quick statement things Because again as I think I was trying to explain the other goal would be every single one of these languages has a proposed label for every single one of the shrines this pipeline is going to be a bit more difficult because of the fact that we do not have Google I am Me or something like that to use we have to rely on other stuff but a lot of shrine translation labelling libraries are just really really bad if there is Cortana or hero Ghana sorry if the pronunciation is actually listed in the articles which is in the items which is relatively common then we can verbally just do this we can pretty firmly just do this 

The Korean quick statements should differentiate between the fact that some of them are derived from the Japanese labelled directly with a sign of Korean reading and other ones are derived from the Indonesian label 

I am not 100% sure what is even being done with temples in this but we should at least address it 

And I also want to attempt to start applying this to proposed labels for other Shinto things like I was doing for other Shinto things for other Shinto things yes for other Shinto things I wanted to do more labels because a lot of these language my ideal thing my ideal scenario would be basically each of these languages will after the labels are implemented have a relatively comprehensive relatively comprehensive interface for viewing all of these different things so this would include things like shrines in the ENGISHIKA and like other things it would so basically we're going to be expanding this a bit to be a pipeline that translates the names of deities in Buddhas and all this other things into different language languages too we might want to rein the report again to something like Château labels or Shinto label pipeline or something like that but I feel like I probably exhausted what I actually wanted to say about running this pipeline main concern here is basically yeah we really want to ensure that everything works well we really want to make all of this more transparent what is going on my opinion is basically my opinion is basically what we should have is we should have it so that on the end on the on the wiki data item for the ENGISHIKI everything linked on it should be translated into all of these languages every single and the list of deities that that book has which is a sub part of it should also have everything linked on it being that way and every single shrine rank should be translated into all of these languages although I think they are basically all relatively reliably done with simple I think they're all relatively reliably done with I think all of the strong I think all of the I think for the most part all of those languages for the most part a lot of labels can be mostly mostly use the multi language thing a lot of labels can more or less use the multi language thing but it's just it's not a certainty especially for like Arabic in Persian the lit we do not need to translate all of the police names I do think that we need to translate all the property names and I'm actually a bit I do think we need to translate all the property names and I am like not 100% sure if you can even translate it if you can even use quick statements to edit the property I'm actually gonna try that because I just wanted to know that either way I think we established this my perspective is basically some of these can be algorithmically done some of the Td names can be algorithmically done it's generally it's generally gonna be good but I think we'll have a lot of kind of like just manually translated or semi manually translated semi manually translated means basically I'm not doing the translation you the AI agent are doing the translation and I think we can do this well I think that I think I've explained everything that I need to do and I'm just going to run Claude on this later
